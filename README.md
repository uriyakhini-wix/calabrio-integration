# Calabrio Integration
Integration with Calabrios WFM tool consists of three main parts: 
 1. Historical data - data used to analyse performance and workload in previous periods, e.g - previous queue loads and ticket resolution times.
 2. Realtime data - realtime data on current workload and agent availabilty.
 3. Initial tenant setup - at the beggining the tenant will need to stet up with agent information, queue information, roles, etc... This information will need to be migrated into the system.
